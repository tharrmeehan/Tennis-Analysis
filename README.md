# Tennis Analysis

The goal of this project was to track the two players and the ball using computer vision method. Mainly, YOLO has been used to track both ball and players, while a model for detecting the tennis court has been trained using ResNet50 and a dataset with still images of different courts. See [DATASET](https://github.com/yastrebksv/TennisCourtDetector).
